// Block Scopes 

// 1. Secruity 
// ensures that variables can only be acessed to pre-defined 
// parts of our program 

// 2. Reduced variable name collisions 
// reduces namespace collisions 
// alows same variable name multiple times in different scopes 

// global scope - the global space is JavaScript
// local scope - created when a function is defined
// block scope - created by entering a pair of curly braces

// lexical scope -> lexical time 
// js without dynamic scoping 
// resolves varible names to their values when functions are nested
